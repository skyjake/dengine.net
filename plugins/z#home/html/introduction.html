<h2>Why Choose Doomsday?</h2>
<p>DOOM and its follow-ups are timeless classics that made the first-person shooter genre popular among gamers. Those fortunate enough to have experienced the games as they were released back in the early 1990s are sure to remember the fluid gameplay and the intense, immersive look and feel. However, by today's standards, the games look and sound dated. This is where Doomsday comes in: we have replaced much of the original engine's technology with a more modern implementation. We aim to provide the same thrilling gameplay experience for today's gamers.</p>
<p>The Doomsday Engine runs on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" class="link-external" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" rel="nofollow">Windows</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" class="link-external" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="nofollow">Unix</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_os" class="link-external" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_os">Mac OS X</a> operating systems and is available for download free of charge.</p>
