<p>The Doomsday Engine is an enhanced DOOM source port for Windows, Mac OS X, and various Unix platforms. It is based on the source code of <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com" title="id Software" class="link-external">id Software's</a> DOOM and <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/" title="Raven Software" class="link-external">Raven Software's</a> Heretic and Hexen.</p>
<p>The purpose of the project is to create a modular game engine with which classic 2.5d first person shooters such as <a href="/doom" title="DOOM">DOOM</a>, <a href="/heretic" title="Heretic">Heretic</a> and <a href="/hexen" title="Hexen">Hexen</a> can be played. We aim to retain the same feel as the original games but leverage modern techniques such as 3D graphics and client/server networking. A lot of emphasis is placed on good-looking graphics.</p>
<p>Our modular design separates game logic from the renderer, audio, network and other such subsystems. This allows the engine to be used with game logic modules (plugins).</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform. Supported platforms include: Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (10.4 or later)</li>
<li>Open source. Software developers should visit the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/deng/" class="link-external"> SourceForge project page</a> for more information</li>
<li>Hardware-accelerated OpenGL graphics engine</li>
<li>3D positional audio for sound effects (not supported by all audio plugins)</li>
<li>16-player client/server networking via TCP/IP with Multiplayer menu for game setup</li>
<li>Graphical Control Panel for configuration, accessed quickly with Shift-Escape</li>
<li>In-game console for modifying settings and giving commands using a command line interface</li>
<li>Configurable player controls (bindings) and input manipulators (smoothing, look spring etc...)</li>
<li>Plain-text definition files for game data such as thing types and states, sound and music information, map configuration and more</li>
</ul>
<h3>Renderer</h3>
<ul>
<li>3D models: Quake's MD2 format and Doomsday's DMD format with LOD support</li>
<li>High-resolution textures (PNG, TGA, PCX) and detail textures</li>
<li>Map lighting emulates the effects of radiosity for a more natual appearance (FakeRadio: shadows in corners)</li>
<li>Smooth movement of objects, world structures and the camera. The original games were limited to the maximum framerate of 35 FPS</li>
<li>Colored, dynamic lighting for world surfaces, 3D models, sprites and particles</li>
<li>Object shadowing effects</li>
<li>Particle generators for special effects</li>
<li>Decoration effects on world surfaces: light sources and particle generators</li>
<li>Lens flares and glowing objects</li>
<li>Support for skyboxes and 3D sky models</li>
</ul>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li>EAX and A3D environmental sound processing effects</li>
<li>Upsampling of sound effects</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Doomsday Engine and the associated ports of DOOM, Heretic and Hexen have been under development since May 1999, when the project was started by Jaakko Ker√§nen (<a href="http://twitter.com/skyjake" class="link-external">skyjake</a>). The first version of the engine, called JHexen at the time, was released on November 1st, 1999. Ports of Heretic and Doom followed in early 2000.</p>
