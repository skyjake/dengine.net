<p>Hexen is the sequel to Heretic, and continues the story of the fight against the Serpent Riders. The game takes place in the realm of Chronos, which is under control of Korax, the second of the Serpent Riders. Three heroes, a Fighter, a Cleric, and a Mage, set out to destroy Korax. The player takes the role of one of these heroes. The choice of character affects the gameplay as each hero has his own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Raven Software released Hexen in 1996. The company had continued making heavy modifications to the DOOM engine, and Hexen introduced such sophisticated features as a scripting language for game events. The maps were well-designed and interconnected with each other, resulting in a more intriguing game world and more complex puzzles to solve.</p>
