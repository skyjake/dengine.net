<p>A server admin is not required to publish their server to this central list (located at <em>http://dengine.net/master.php</em>), however it will then only be findable by clients who enter the IP address manually. A server may be published here but remain "closed" (requiring a password to join). Further information about the master server is available <a href="/dew/index.php?title=Master_server" title="Documentation for the master server">here</a>.</p>
<p>An XML version of this server list is available <a href="/master.php?xml" title="Master Server Log (XML)">here</a>.</p>
