<section id="overview"><p>In addition to the many thousands of fan-made mods and add-ons available for the <a href="games" title="games">games</a> which the Doomsday Engine supports, there are add-ons specifically created for use with Doomsday. Such add-ons include high-resolution graphics, audio packs and even 3D models of your favorite nightmare creatures. Here you will find a collection of some our own favorite user-created add-on packages.</p>
<p id="notes">Note: A torrent client is needed to download these packages (we recommend <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" rel="nofollow" class="link-external" title="http://www.utorrent.com/">&#181;Torrent</a> - its small, easy to use and it works). The standard <a href="#install">installation instructions</a> can be found at the bottom of this page (though some add-ons may require additional install steps).</p></section>
