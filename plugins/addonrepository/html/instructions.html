<p>Last update: 2009-01-16</p>

<p>The majority of the packages made available here can be installed via any of the following methods.</p>
<h3>Install a package for use with the Doomsday Engine Frontend (a.k.a Snowberry)</h3>
<h4>Installation via the Frontend's GUI</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Download your chosen add-on package(s) to some temporay location e.g., your desktop</li>
    <li>Start the Doomsday Engine Frontend</li>
    <li>Navigate to the <em>Add-ons</em> tab</li>
    <li>Click the <em>+</em> button to open the Add-on Installer wizard</li>
    <li>Click the <em>...</em> button to open the folder browser</li>
    <li>Use the folder browser to locate the folder where you downloaded the package(s) to</li>
    <li>Click <em>Ok</em></li>
    <li>The Add-on Installer should now feature a list of all compatible packages in the chosen folder. Click to select each package that you would like to install</li>
    <li>Click <em>Install</em></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point the Frontend will install the selected packages and make them available for you to use via the "Add-ons" tab. You can now delete the package(s) from their temporary location (e.g., your desktop).</p>
<h4>Manual installation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Download the chosen package(s) directly into the <em>Add-ons</em> subdirectory of your Snowberry installation e.g., <em>c:/program files/doomsday/snowberry/addons/</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Once installed you still need to "enable" packages via the "Add-ons" tab, by <strong>checking</strong> the box(es) adjacent to the name(s) of the package(s) you wish to use.</p>
<h3>Other installation methods</h3>
<p>If for whatever reason you do not use the Doomsday Engine Frontend, you will need to download your chosen package(s) and then install them manually. Typically, each package contains it's own installation instructions which must be followed for a successful manual install.</p>
