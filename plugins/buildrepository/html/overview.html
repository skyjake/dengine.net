<p>Doomsday's automated build system has been set up for triweekly releases. Every week at 12:00 (EET) on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the system tags and builds a new release. Packages produced from new builds become available for download within a couple of hours from build time. Further information about the build system is available <a href="http://dengine.net/dew/index.php?title=Automated_build_system" title="Documentation for the automated build system">here</a>.</p>
